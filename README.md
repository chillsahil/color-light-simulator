# Color Light Simulator

Interactive React component to tweak lighting in real time:

- **Color**: adjust in perceptually uniform L\*a\*b space via presets or custom hex input  
- **Intensity**: control brightness from 0â€‰% to 100â€‰% with slider or numeric input  
- **Roughness**: simulate material finish from glass (0.05) to rock (1.00)  

Built with TypeScript and [chroma.js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/), drop it into any React app or 3D renderer to instantly preview your scene under different lighting conditions.
